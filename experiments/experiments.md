### Dimming an LED using a Potentiometer ###

In this experiment, the goal was to be able to push the switch to turn the LED on and off. As well as use the Potentiometer to be able to dim the LED when it was on.

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was the use of using a Potentiometer to dim a light and the coding of two continuous loops. I learned that a Potentiometer controls the voltage that is given to the LED using a dial. As well as the two codes that are running simultaneously. One for when the push switch is pressed to turn on the light, and the other that controls the Potentiometer, which controls the brightness of the LED when the LED is on. What is new is the idea of being able to code multiple loops and having them run at the same time.

This experiment could be the basis of a real-world application such as the use of an internal lighting system in homes. The use of dimming lights in a home works the same way in which a switch is turned on and the dial is used to determine the voltage that the LED is reading, which determines the brightness of the LED. 

### Using A Transistor to drive a Motor ###

In this experiment, the transistor is turning on and off which controls the speed that the motor is spinning.

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was the piece of equipment known as the Transistor. It was interesting to find out that the transistor only uses a small amount of electrical current is used to operate the component which then allows a flow of current through. In the "Kitronik Inventor's Kit Tutorial Book" it was described as a gate that the current from the Micro:Bit is used to open the gate and allow a large amount of current through. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real-world application such as amplifying weak signals to run big machinery. The transistor motor is used when there isn't enough power to run the equipment. SO this has the real-world use of when a piece of machinery requires a lot of power, but only has a certain amount of power available a Transistor would be used to help run the machinery.

### Setting the Tone with a Piezo Buzzer ###

In this experiment, the code tells the Micro:Bit when a button is pressed on the Micro:Bit to play a tune through the buzzer.

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was the use of using code to create a sound. The music blocks that were used create varying audio tones, these tones are then sent to Pin 0. When the button is pressed the programed amount of Hz or key will be played.

This experiment could be the basis of a real-world application such as game buzzers. These buzzers work so that once pressed a certain sound is played. 

### Wind Power ###

This experiment uses the spinning of the fan motor to generate a voltage that can be measured.

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was the coding for Java Script, instead of Blocks. This was the first experiment that I had used Javascript coding. I found that it was more difficult to create, but also easier to read. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real-world application such as the use of wind turbines. Wind Turbines are based on the idea of being able to use the kinetic energy in the wind and being able to convert it to a usable voltage.

### Capacitor Charge Circuit ###

This experiment uses a circuit to charge a capacitor to be charged through the Potentiometer. The Micro:Bit has been programmed to turn on the LED at certain charge levels.

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was the idea of charging a circuit using a capacitor and some kind of resistor. It was interesting to see different ways that the circuit could be used.

This experiment could be the basis of a real-world application such as a timing gate. Once a certain charge is passed the first gate lowers and as each charge passes the process continues until the whole gate is lowered.
